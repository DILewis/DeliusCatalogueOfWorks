                    <span>Welcome to the Delius Catalogue of Works.
This is a free resource created through a collaborative project between the
University of Oxford, the British Library, and the Royal Library, Denmark,
funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council. Using the menu bar, you
will be able to browse or search the catalogue. Additional sections contain a complete
scholarly introduction, a full appendix to the catalogue, and information on
the project and the people involved. </span>

                    <span>The Delius Catalogue of Works (DCW) is
the first thematic catalogue of the composer’s works, and the first to be
digital. Previous cataloguing has been undertaken by <span>Rachel Lowe</span> and <span>Robert Threlfall</span>,
yet for all their value and expert scholarship these sources now present a
number of problems. There is a disparity between Lowe’s object of study
(Delius’s manuscripts as held by the Delius Trust) and Threlfall’s (Delius’s
complete works), which presents a challenge for a non-specialist trying to
compare information in each source. With the handing-over of a huge amount of
material from the library of Sir Thomas Beecham to the Delius Trust in 1982,
and the subsequent deposit of the complete collection in the British Library,
the catalogues’ information on sources and manuscript locations is now out of
date. While Threlfall’s supplementary catalogue gives an invaluable detailed
description of the Beecham material, it cannot be used without reference to the
original catalogue. Moreover, the lack of availability of manuscript material
before this juncture resulted in areas of confusion in Threlfall’s original
numbering system. An unfinished work that may, or may not, be entitled <i>A
l’Amore</i> is denoted as a work, while the <i>Petite Suite d’Orchestre</i>
(DCW A 6; RT VI/6) and the <i>Suite de 3 Morceaux Caracteristiques</i> (DCW
Coll. 1; RT VI/6(a)) are two distinct works/collections that were originally
conflated by Threlfall. Finally, given that the British Library’s catalogue of
manuscripts is fully available online, and that many interested parties
(scholars, musicians, enthusiasts) are increasingly likely to start a search
for authoritative information on the internet, it makes sense to produce a
fully digital resource. This decision was given further impetus by the
development of the MerMEId software by the Danish Centre for Music Editing at
the Royal Library, Denmark (</span>

                    <span>. The software, developed in the course of
creating a digital thematic catalogue of the works of Carl Nielsen, has
facilitated the creation of a clear, accessible, and user-friendly resource. </span>

Research Council for funding the project. </span>
