                            Lowe writes that this is ‘an undistinguished salon piece, in
                            which Delius can still be seen to be struggling to provide movement
                            in the bass with small success, and there is little or no interaction
                            between the stodgy accompaniment and the soloist’ (RL, 111). The 
                            autograph score is extant in GB-Lbl MS Mus. 1745/1/35, bearing a
