                <h2 id="AimsOfTheCatalogue">Aims of the catalogue</h2>
                <p class="MsoNoSpacing">
                    <span>The catalogue was
created as part of the wider project ‘Delius, Modernism, and the Sound of
Place’. This project pursued a new and comprehensive evaluation of Delius,
testing the veracity of constructions of the composer as a nationalist and
rhapsodic musical portraitist, investigating his compositional methods, and
situating him within both different geographical contexts and the complex
cultural phenomenon of modernism. Consequently, it was the aim of the catalogue
to produce a resource that facilitated this investigation, that provided
thorough and up-to-date information on the state of sources for a given work,
its process of composition, editing, and revision, its performance history and
its relationship to other works. At the same time, we wanted to create a
practical resource of use to performers and general listeners. Thus,
information such as publishing details, full instrumentation, and duration, as
well as comprehensive search functions, have been incorporated. </span>

                <h2 id="SourceMaterials">Source materials</h2>
                <p class="MsoNoSpacing">
                    <span>The vast majority of
Delius’s manuscripts are now held by the British Library, being transferred
from the Delius Trust in 1995. The </span>

                    </a>
                    <span> comprises four sets of
material: the manuscripts originally held by the Delius Trust, almost all
coming from the Delius house at Grez-sur-Loing (British Library MS Mus.
1745/1); manuscripts passed to the Delius Trust from the Beecham Library (MS
Mus. 1745/2); manuscripts passed to the Delius Trust by Boosey &amp; Hawkes
music publishers (MS Mus. 1745/3), and miscellaneous individual accessions
(1745/4). The contents of the entire collection are described in the digital
catalogue of the British Library, but it is important to note that this is not
equivalent to a complete catalogue of works. Some manuscripts and material have
been lost, and other items are held elsewhere. The Delius Trust retains a
number of items not in Delius’s manuscript but of considerable interest in
establishing the history of works, such as copies made of manuscripts and
corrected by the composer, and a number of early editions owned by Sir Thomas
Beecham and covered with his famous ‘blue pencil’ annotations. The Trust
continues to acquire material that becomes available at auction. In addition, a
small collection is held by the Percy Grainger Museum at the University of
Melbourne, and other items are held elsewhere, notably the autograph score of <i>Koanga</i>
in the Carl S. Swisher Library of Jacksonville University. Every effort has
been made in the Delius Catalogue of Works to provide an up-to-date and
comprehensive account of manuscript and other relevant sources. </span>

                <h2 id="Methodology">Methodology</h2>
                <p class="MsoNoSpacing">
                    <span>The creation of a
digital catalogue raises a large number of methodological issues. While musical
works are inherently ambiguous objects, a catalogue demands definite decisions
as to the definition and dating of a work, and the ordering of the whole. There
are problems common to any catalogue, such as those of numbering works, how
much information to include, and how far to follow the practices of previous
cataloguers. There are also issues distinct to the digital catalogue, and
opportunities that do not present themselves in printed resources. Our primary
points of reference throughout have been Robert Threlfall’s two catalogues, as
a precedent for ordering the works of Delius, and the digital </span>
                    <a href="http://www.kb.dk/dcm/cnw/navigation.xq">
                        <span>Catalogue of Carl Nielsen's Works</span>
                    </a>
                    <span> (CNW) created using
MerMEId. In general, we have been guided by aspects of both catalogues, but
have deviated from their practices where appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <h3 id="Works">Works, fragments,
versions, arrangements, and collections</h3>
                <p class="MsoNoSpacing">
                    <span>In this catalogue, a
work has its own record and an individual DCW number. A given piece is defined
as a work where it is coherent and complete work (even if, say, lacking
complete orchestration) and it has some public presence, either in the form of
publication or performance, though not necessarily both. Thus a number of works
identified and numbered by Threlfall, for example <i>
                            <a href="appendix.html#DCW-A1">Zanoni</a>
                        </i>
(RT I/1) or <i>
                            <a href="appendix.html#DCW-A3">Légendes
(Sagen)</a>
                        </i> for piano and orchestra (RT VII/2), are not deemed works and have
not been included here in the catalogue proper. Any identifiable piece of music
that remains unfinished or fragmentary is listed in the Appendix. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="MsoNoSpacing">
                    <span>Another
area of ambiguity is where one work is included within another, or where a work
comprises several versions, possibly with different titles. In the case of the
former, where the original and/or later work have their own performance or
publication history, they will each be denoted as an individual work. <i>Mitternachtslied
Zarathustras</i> is therefore given a DCW number, because it was composed and performed
as an independent work, before being incorporated into <i>A Mass of Life</i>.
By contrast, <i>La Ronde se déroule</i> (RT VI/13) is the first version of the
later <a href="http://catalogue.t-mus.org/delius/document.xq?doc=delius_lebenstanz.xml">
                            <i>Life’s Dance</i>
                        </a> (VI/15), 
and is therefore incorporated into that DCW record.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="MsoNoSpacing">
                    <span>The
matter of arrangements is especially complex in the case of Delius, given that
some arrangements – such as ‘La Calinda’ – are better known than the original
work, and also given the large amount of arrangement undertaken by others at
Delius’s behest or after his death. In this catalogue, on the whole,
arrangements are listed within the DCW record only where Delius himself
undertook the arrangement. Exceptions are where, for example, Delius engaged
others to produce vocal scores of his operas shortly after composition, and thus
the arrangement constitutes part of the preparation for performance or study
rather than an independent creative output. Where the arrangement is a creative
interpretation of Delius' original work undertaken with a new medium of
performance in mind, it is listed in the <a href="http://catalogue.t-mus.org/delius/appendix.html">Appendix</a>. Thus, 'La Calinda', while
well-known in its own right, is listed in the <a href="http://catalogue.t-mus.org/delius/appendix.html">Appendix</a> as an arrangement of
material from <a href="http://catalogue.t-mus.org/delius/document.xq?doc=delius_koanga.xml">
                            <i>Koanga</i>
                        </a> 
by Eric Fenby. One ambivalent and exceptional category within these rules is 
those sources dictated by Delius to others, notably Fenby, when suffering from
paralysis in his last years. In such cases, sources are included with the work 
record, and connoted by the term ‘authorize’ added to the title of a source.
</span>
                </p>
                <p class="MsoNoSpacing">
                    <span>A
final problematic category is those works made up of parts, in which it is not
clear whether the work is identical to the whole collection or to the
constituent parts. The obvious example is song collections, but there are also
confusing cases in Delius’s <i>oeuvre</i> like the <a href="http://catalogue.t-mus.org/delius/document.xq?doc=delius_twopiecessmallorch.xml">Two
Pieces for Small Orchestra</a> (RT VI/19), made up of the miniatures 
<a href="http://catalogue.t-mus.org/delius/document.xq?doc=delius_onhearingfirstcuckoo.xml">‘On
Hearing the First Cuckoo in Spring’</a> and <a href="http://catalogue.t-mus.org/delius/document.xq?doc=delius_summernight.xml">‘Summer
Night on the River’</a>, each with its own performance and
publication history. In the case of song collections, where a given work is a
group of related, but independent songs (e.g. Five Songs from the Norwegian),
each song is given an individual DCW number, while the collection is given a
collection number (e.g. DCW Coll. 1). This renders searching and browsing
easier, and allows the presentation of information common to the whole as well
as that relevant only to an individual item. Where the work is an integral
whole consisting of several songs, as for example in <i>Songs of Sunset</i>,
they are not granted individual DCW numbers but are treated like movements. In
addition to this treatment of songs, the method of attributing a ‘Coll.’ number
has been adopted in the case of instrumental works that have a history both as
a complete work and with regard to constituent items, as in the case of the Two
Pieces or the <a href="http://catalogue.t-mus.org/delius/document.xq?doc=delius_3symphonischedichtungen.xml">3
Symphonische Dichtungen</a>.</span>

                <p class="MsoNoSpacing">
                    <span>Dating of works where it
concerns a single point of completion is invariably difficult, especially in
the case of works that underwent revision over several years. The date or date
span given in each case reflects the period of composition. Where the work
exists in several versions, an overall timespan is given from first to last
version, and the dates of composition of each version are given in the course
of describing them. </span>

                <h3 id="Numbering">Numbering</h3>
                <p class="MsoNoSpacing">
                    <span>The numbering system of
the catalogue has been devised with two considerations in mind: i) optimal
compatibility with MerMEId, which offers a specific ordering and categorisation
of works by genre and ii) the avoidance of confusion with Threlfall’s ordering,
given that his very first work, <i>
                            <a href="appendix.html#DCW-A1">Zanoni</a>
                        </i>, 
is relegated to the Appendix
here. Bearing these factors in mind, works are numbered from DCW 1 onwards, by
genre, as follows:</span>
                </p>
                <ul class="staticText">

                    <span>Within each category,
works are ordered chronologically. </span>

                <p class="MsoNoSpacing">
                    <span>A number of key players
in Delius’s life had more than one name. Delius himself was Fritz until he
adopted the anglicised name ‘Frederick’ in the course of 1902. His wife Jelka
was Jelka Rosen before her marriage, and his friend Philip Heseltine is known
by his compositional <i>nom de plume</i> Peter Warlock. In order to avoid
confusion or difficulties in searching, we have referred to each such
individual consistently, and have further used a mechanism in MerMEId to link
each name to the VIAF authority files associated with the person. An exception
is in the prose descriptions of letters and manuscripts and in citation, where
original names and spellings have been preserved. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="MsoNoSpacing">
                    <span> Titles
of Delius’s works can occasionally prove problematic. Delius gave the same
title to different works more than once (<i>Paa Vidderne</i> and <i>Appalachia</i>),
while also frequently changing titles during composition or adding multiple
ones in different languages to title pages. Here, the main title is always that
which Delius himself chose as the final title of the finished work, as
indicated by the autograph score, where that is extant. We eschew the practice
of referring to the instrumental works just cited as <i>On the Mountains</i>
and <i>American Rhapsody</i> respectively. </span>

level represents the physical embodiment of an expression of the work, such as
the first edition of a musical work, or the recording of a particular

Complete information (including number of folia etc) is not provided, but links
to the British Library catalogue or other sources of more information are
always given, and an overview of the nature and significance of each source
will also be provided. This section also provides generic classificatory
information about each source, namely whether it is music or text, print or
manuscript, autograph or copy, its position in the compositional process
(sketch, draft, fair copy, first edition etc), its scoring (full, short etc),
and its level of completion. The terms within the latter classification have
specific meanings in MerMEId. ‘Incomplete’ indicates the full work but with one
or more parts missing; ‘Excerpt’ indicates that sections of the work have been
intentionally omitted; ‘Fragment’ indicates that portions have been lost. </span>
