# DeliusCatalogueOfWorks
This repository contains the extra files needed to publish a working MerMEId instance for the **Delius Catalogue of Works**. You will need a copy of the Edirom version of MerMEId and a server with Docker installed. The instructions below assume an Apache server, but there are no specialised requirements for the main web server, with most URL rewriting done from within Docker.
